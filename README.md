# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-GUI
Simple GUI implementation of the Monte Carlo Simulation with Geometric Brownian Motion. Currently only works sporadically, courtesy of the yahoo-finance API. 

Initially made in 2016 for use within the risk management team of the Asset Accounting & Finance Investments Committee.

Code to create the GUI was taken mostly from a tutorial which I would love to credit if I could still find it...

# TODO:
- Find a free API to pull historical stock data from that doesn't require an API key.
